# AVANAVA – Public Registry

This repository hosts the early public registry for AVANAVA:
concept entries, licence records, and timestamped releases.

It links directly to the AVANAVA site and will later be mirrored
to Zenodo for DOI-based archival snapshots.

This is a minimal initial version. Folders and structure will
expand as concepts are added to the Registry.
